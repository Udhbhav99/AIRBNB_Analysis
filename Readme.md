# Airbnb Analysis Project

### Objective:

The project aims to analyze Airbnb data to uncover insights about property listings, 
pricing trends, ratings, properties and other relevant metrics. 
This analysis will help stakeholders make informed decisions regarding their properties.

### Data Source:

MongoDB: The primary database for storing and retrieving Airbnb data. 
Data is extracted and transformed for analysis.

### Tools used:
Python: The programming language used for data extraction, processing, and analysis.

Pandas: Utilized for creating and manipulating data frames. Provides efficient data handling and transformation capabilities.

Plotly Express: Used for creating interactive visualizations to explore data patterns and trends.

Matplotlib: Employed for generating static visualizations and detailed plots, providing a deeper understanding of the data.

Streamlit: A web application framework used to create an interactive user interface. This allows users to interact with the data and visualizations seamlessly.

### Work flow:

1) Data Extraction And Pre-Processing:

    - Establishing connection to MongoDB. 
    Extracting relevant data to Pandas Dataframe.

    - Cleaning and preprocessing the data using pandas.

2) EDA:
     
    - Analyze key metrics such as average pricing, occupancy rates, availability etc.
    - Use Pandas to perform statistical analysis
    - Create interactive plots using Plotly Express and Matplotlib to visualize trends, distributions, and relationships in the data.

3) User Interface:
    
    - Develop an interactive interface with
    Streamlit to allow users to explore data and visualizations dynamically.
    - Implement features such as filtering, sorting, and searching to enhance user experience
